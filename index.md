## About Me

I'm currently a third year Ph.D. student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by [Dr. Mohammad Amiri](https://mmamiri.github.io/) and [Dr. Tomek Strzalkowski](https://lacailab.cogsci.rpi.edu/). I work on building scalable AI systems that enable deeper human-AI collaboration and understanding over long-term interactions. My recent research lies in the efficiency and long-context memory capabilities of LLMs, with the broader goal of developing lifelong learning systems that can adapt to dynamic, evolving environments.

Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I co-founded two startup companies with a strong focus on AI technology.
