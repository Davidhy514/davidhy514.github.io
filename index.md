## About Me

I'm currently a second year Ph.D. student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Dr. Mohammad Amiri and Dr. Tomek Strzalkowski. My research lies broadly in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - with a focus on building intelligent AI systems that enable enhanced human-AI collaboration. My recent research interests are related to continual learning and efficiency, exploring how to create models that are lifelong learners that can adapt to dynamic environments.

Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I co-founded two startup companies with a strong focus on AI technology.
